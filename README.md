# System-Architect
One of the critical roles of an architecth is to design and to define the best practices of Large scale system

Inorder to design a large scale system, just the application design will not be sufficient.

For example of Application Design :
          UI -> Web Application -> Business Service -> Database
          
We need to consider key factors of NFR and system requirements
Key Factors of to consider:

- **Performance** : TPS requriement to be fulfilled. For example, 90 trades per second
- **Scalability** : System should be able to handle huge number of requests and scale up and down automatically based on the load
- **Reliability** : High availability of the system even if few services (like nodes) of the system goes unavailable
- **Security**    : How to securily transfer and store the data, secure the system using strict firewall methods and authentication and access
- **Deployment**  : Deployment of various components across the system
- **Technology Stack** : Select the proper technology and tools
